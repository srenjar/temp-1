Let us enjoy reading this story of The Cap-Seller and The Monkeys.
Once, there was a cap-seller in a town. On one fine day, he was selling caps.
“Caps, caps, caps….Five rupees caps, ten rupees caps…."
After he made few sales of caps, he became very tired. He decided to sit under a big tree to take rest for a while. Soon, he slept off.

There were many monkeys on the big tree. They saw the cap-seller was sleeping under the tree. The monkeys were sitting on the top of the tree. The monkeys came down, took the caps from the cap-seller-bag and wore them. Then they climbed the tree again.
